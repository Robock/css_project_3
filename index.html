     <h2 class="boxes"> What is HTML? </h2>
     <p><b>HTML</b> is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a file system by
     which individuals communicate with computers. We write code in HTML format.
     Just like we write text in Microsoft Word to communicate with other humans,
     we use <em> Text Editors </em> to communicate with computers. A <b> Text
        Editor</b> is a piece of software that is used to write, edit and save
         code. We have a few options of text editors that we can use like Atom,
          Sublime Text, Brackets, etc. 
     </p>
     <p>In order to write code, we need to think like a programmer. The 5 ways
    programmers think are:
     </p>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Procedural Thinking</dt>
                  <dd>A method of thinking that involves several steps.</dd>
                  <dt>Abstract Thinking</dt>
                  <dd>Finding similarities in different things to create
                    <em>Generality</em>.</dd>
                  <dt>Systematic Debugging</dt>
                  <dd>Finding possible causes of problems and fixing it.</dd>
                  <dt>Technological Empathy</dt>
                  <dd>A computer is a tool that outputs information based on
                    what a user inputs and programmers need to be mindful of
                    that.</dd>
                    <dt> Systems Thinking</dt>
                    <dd> Breaking big problems into smaller pieces.</dd>
                </dl>

     <h2 class="spweb"> The World Wide Web</h2>
     <p>The major components of the web are:
         1) Browser, 2) Internet, 3) HTTP and
      4) Servers. A browser is something like an internet explorer, chrome, firefox
      or safari that makes request via the internet to servers. These requests
      are made using an internet connection and a protocol called HTTP. HTTP
      stands for <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>. Servers are dedicated
      computers that respond to the request from users with files that
      is displayed in the users' browser.

     <h3> HTML Markup / HTML Tag</h3>
     <p>There are many types of Tags and Attributes
      that are used and the instructor has provided us with a <a href=
      "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp"> reference</a>. 
      Another thing I learned in this class is how to manage whitespace and
      have text on multiple lines using <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> methods.

     <h2 class="sty">Make a stylish web page</h2>
     <p>Both HTML and CSS are languages. HTML controls the "structure" while CSS controls "style".
  The analogy of a house's structure being similar to HTML while the paint and decoration 
  of the house is similar to what CSS does to web pages is very helpful to understand web page design. 
  Along the same vein, you can think of JavaScript as an interactive tool in the house 
  like a tv remote controller or garage door opener.

  Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like structure of a page. This structure can easily be
  seen by using Developer Tools or Dev Tools in browsers.

  Another little caveat I learned about web pages is that you can think of everything on a web page as 
  boxes and these boxes useDiv tag to differentiate themselves from other boxes. Class attributes
  are used as labels for these boxes. Using Div tags helps group similar things together in a box 
  thereby giving our code a structure. This practice also helps to modify the code in the future 
  because related content is grouped together.

     <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. In a cascading relationship, the most specific 
  rule at the bottom of the cascading rules applies to everything. A rule in CSS is made
  in a form of a declaration. A declaration is enclosed in a pair of curly braces having
  a property followed by a colon and a value followed by a semicolon. Each declaration 
  uses selectors. A selector is a CSS code that selects a specific style for a component 
  of an HTML element. Selector is basically the name you use in order to target the 
  elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in HTML. A class refers to a 
  group of elements that can be styled together while ID's are unique identifiers that
  uniquely identify an element in HTML. </p>
  
    <p>The 3 ways to include CSS styling in web pages are:</p>
      <ol class="lis">
        <li>Write CSS in the head of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS file.</li>
        <li>Write your style inline with your HTML (not recommonded).</li>
      </ol>
